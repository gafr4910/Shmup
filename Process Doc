Initial Ideation

My initial ideas included:
  - an environmental protection game where the player would shoot garbage to protect the ocean.
  - a furniture game where players would fire nuts and bolts at random parts of furniture to create strange furniture creations
  - a restaurant game where players would fend off hordes of hungry customers while dogding forks, plates, and other utensils
  - a game based on Impressionist paintings (less developed concept, more of a visual style)
  - a game where players defend the human body from infection as the immune system
  - a smore/shish kebab game where players would fire skewers that can pierce multiple enemies at once to gain more points
  - a game based on Undertale, where how players defeated waves of enemies determine how future bosses and later waves behave
  
At first, I was going to do the shish kebab game, as the mechanic of lining up enemies and shooting skewers seemed like it 
would be very satisfying, I turned away from this as it wouldn'tlend itself to a shmup, where players typically shoot wildly 
into waves of enemies and don't have time to make each shot count. As I returned to ideating and considering my previous ideas,
I wondered what it would be like if Undertale were a shmup instead of an rpg.

This led to a few main ideas for game mechanics:
  - Players would be able to choose between weapons typical of the shmup genre (blasters, lasers, etc.), and a weapon that 
    pushes enemies slightly, but doesn't do damage. After a few hits with this weapon, enemies would become friendly and leave
    the screen.
  - The game would keep track of how players play; "killing" more enemies will result in harder, more aggresive bosses and
    larger waves of enemies, while being nonviolent would make boss fights relatively easier and more about dogding.
  - There may also be different story elements (depending on time constraints) that would create different experiences based on
    how the player plays the game.

I liked this idea particularly because I could easily imagine the Undertale characters fitting into typical sci-fi roles in a
reimagined story based in space. This is the 



Iteration 1

I will build off of the IGDPAD shmup from chapters 30-31, utilizing the multiple weapon options, enemy
types, and the general ability to customize these to make the Undertale shmup.



Feedback/Halfway point:
Didn't really get feedback as I used the time mostly as a workday. At this point, I had weapon switching mostly implemented,
with blaster, spread, and push/befriend weapon types. From here, I needed to alter how enemies spawn (how many of each type, 
how many total, how many must be defeated to trigger boss), finish weapon switching, add a boss, and have the game keep track
of the number of enemies that have been destroyed and befriended.
